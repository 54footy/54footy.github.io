			<p>You have an idea for an app that you haven't seen out in the world yet. It might even be just a slightly better version of an existing app that does this "one thing" just a little bit better. But you have no idea where to start. You have 2 main options at this point.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1. You could learn to program and make the app yourself</strong>. But, this has a pretty steep learning curve. You also may not really have hours upon hours to spend outside of your normal routine to sit in front of a computer learning something for the next 6 months. Besides you don't want really want a phD in Computer Science you just want to see your idea out in the world and not 10 months later.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2. You could hire somebody to do it.</strong> This has it's own set of challenges. It's hard to manage a software project if you've never done it before and in this case lost time is expensive. It's also hard to justify spending thousands of dollars on something you're not even sure you like yourself yet. So, by the end of it you've spent a good chunk of money on something you haven't seen until the very end and aren't even sure its what you initially asked for. Software companies at all sizes have this problem internally as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				The truth is there is a safe way to explore your idea for an app and software companies all around the world use this technique every day. It's called getting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">MVP</a>. This basically means a prototype for your idea and it's the step between spending a ton of money developing a full on application and having an "aha moment" for an app. It's a rapid prototype to explore what works and doesn't work about your idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				With a MVP/prototype you can figure out if you like your idea, inspire others to work with you, start getting users, and possibly even get investment from someone else that likes your idea. But you need something you can use before you do all those things and not just some notes on a napkin. Take a look at these early prototypes from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Original-facebook.jpg">Facebook</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://cl.ly/3W2E1P0I2x090Q2b1k3B/o">twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/original/0000/4903/4903v1.png">tumblr</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://kottke.org/plus/misc/yahoo-1994/">yahoo!</a>. Pretty "minimum" right?

			<p>If you're excited about your idea and want to see it out in the world just enter your email above to send me a note. I'll ask you a few questions, tell you the price, and if it makes sense we can get your idea out of your head and into the world. <br><br>
